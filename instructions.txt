Plant-Based Fajitas
1. Prepare the Tex-Mex Flavor Bombs and the Cashew Sour Cream
2. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, onion, and bell pepper and stir to coat with the oil. Raise the heatto medium-high and saute, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for about 6 minutes, until the veggies start to soften.
3. Add the flavor Bombs to the vegetables and cook, stirring frequently, until the flavor Bombs melt, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Add the water to the skillet and stir until the veggies are coated in sauce. Simmer, uncovered, until the veggies have absorbed the sauce and are cooked to your liking, 2 to 4 minutes more.
5. Stir in the black beans, cook for another minute, until heated through, then remove from the heat. 
6. Meanwhile, slice an avocado or two. Portion the avocado among 6 tortillas then top with cilantro and Cashew Sour Cream.
7. When the sauteed vegetables are ready, taste and season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lime juice. Divide the veggies evenly among the tortillas, roll up, and enjoy!
